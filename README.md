# PlantQuest API

PlantQuest API is a comprehensive Flask-based backend service for plant identification, health assessment, user-driven plant registration, location tracking, quest management, and plant adoption. It integrates the KindWise Plant API for AI-powered plant analysis and uses Firebase Firestore as the real-time database backend.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- KindWise Plant API key
- Required Python packages

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone 
cd 
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure `requirements.txt` includes:

```
Flask
firebase-admin
kindwise
Pillow
imagehash
geopy
pytz
```

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Enable Firestore database.
3. Generate a service account key JSON file from Project Settings > Service Accounts.
4. Save the JSON file locally (e.g., `/path/to/firebase-adminsdk.json`).
5. Update Firebase initialization paths in your Flask app code:

```python
cred = credentials.Certificate("/path/to/firebase-adminsdk.json")
initialize_app(cred)
```

### KindWise Plant API Setup

Obtain your API key from KindWise and update the initialization:

```python
plant_api = PlantApi('')
```

### Running the Application

Run the Flask app with:

```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:5000`.

---

## Configuration

- **Firebase credentials path**: Update `credentials.Certificate()` path in both parts of the code.
- **KindWise API key**: Replace the placeholder with your actual API key.
- **Image paths**: Ensure the server can access the image paths provided in requests.
- **Timezone**: Default set to Asia/Kolkata; adjust if needed.

}
```

---

### Plant Registration

#### POST `/api/register-plant`

Register a new plant with user info, location, and image.

**Request JSON:**

  "lng": 98.765432,
  "image_path": "/path/to/plant_image.jpg"
}
```

**Response:**

}
```

- Failure (400 or 409):

  "lng": 98.765432
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "üìç Location updated successfully"
}
```

---

#### GET `/quests/nearby`

    ...
  ]
}
```

---

#### POST `/user/adopt`

  "timestamp": "2025-05-13T13:31:00.000000"
}
```

---

## How It Works

- **Plant Analysis**: Uses KindWise API to identify and analyze plant health from images.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses perceptual image hashing to avoid registering duplicate plants in close proximity.
- **Location-Based Quests**: Users can receive quests related to plants near their current location.
- **Adoption & Rewards**: Users can adopt plants and complete quests to earn eco points.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Firebase Firestore stores and syncs user, plant, quest, and photo data.

---

## Notes

- Image files must be accessible to the Flask server.
- Geolocation radius for quests is 500 meters.
- Image similarity threshold is set to 5 (average hash difference).
- Firebase Firestore security rules should be configured to allow appropriate read/write operations.
- Timezone is set to Asia/Kolkata by default.
